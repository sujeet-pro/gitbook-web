# Preparing for SDI

* Ask Refining Questions
  * Functional and non-functional requirements
* Handle the data
  * Size of the data right now
  * Rate of growth for the data
  * How will the data be consumed by other subsystems or end users
  * Is the data read-heavy or write heavy?
  * Do we need strict consistency of data? or eventual consistency work?
  * What's the durability target of the data
  * What privacy or regulatory requirements do we require for storing or transmitting user data?
* Discuss the components
* Discuss Trade-offs
